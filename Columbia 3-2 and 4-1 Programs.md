   > The 4-1 Program provides Columbia Engineering (SEAS) students with the opportunity to expand their education in liberal arts through an additional year of study at Columbia College (CC), including the completion of a CC major or concentration. At the end of the fifth year of study, students receive a bachelor of arts degree from CC in addition to a bachelor of science degree from SEAS. Admitted students are eligible for a fifth year of housing and financial aid. Students who are accepted and decide to matriculate into the 4-1 Program are required to be in residence at Columbia College for two semesters and complete at least 31 credits during their fifth year. A maximum of 93 points can be transferred from the B.S. degree to the B.A. degree.
