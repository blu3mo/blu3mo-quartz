 >  The paper "A Survey on Gender Bias in Natural Language Processing" by Karolina StaÅ„czak and Isabelle Augenstein presents a survey of 304 papers on gender bias in natural language processing (NLP). The authors find that research on gender bias in NLP often treats gender as a binary variable, neglecting its fluidity and continuity, and is primarily focused on monolingual English or other high-resource languages. Additionally, many newly developed algorithms do not test for bias and disregard ethical considerations, and the methodologies used in this research are limited in scope and lack evaluation baselines and pipelines. The authors argue that overcoming these limitations is necessary for the development of future research on gender bias in NLP.

 >  The paper "A Survey on Gender Bias in Natural Language Processing" does not provide a specific definition of gender bias. However, the authors discuss how gender is defined within the social sciences and how this relates to formal definitions of gender bias in NLP research. In general, gender is often considered a social construct that refers to the attitudes, behaviors, and expectations associated with being male or female in a given society. Gender bias, then, refers to the ways in which language can be used to reproduce and reinforce harmful stereotypes and biases based on gender. The authors of the paper note that most research on gender bias in NLP treats gender as a binary variable, neglecting its fluidity and continuity.
