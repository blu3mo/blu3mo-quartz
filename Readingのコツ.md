It's helpful to write a one sentence summary of what is "happening" in each paragraph as a way to clarify the argument to yourself, as well as to have handy notes for yourself when you discuss the reading in class. This isn't always an ideal strategy for difficult essays, of course, as some are quite long! But if you feel really stuck with the Butler, try this strategy out.
