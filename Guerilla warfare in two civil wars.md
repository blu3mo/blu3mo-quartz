      * Unpopular Diem and US Force
        * US widely known as US puppet
        * Opresed population using secret polices and amry forces, mainly communsits
        * Catholic policy,  Buddhists burned themselves as protest
        * Even VPOTUS Johnson evaluated his governing policy negatively on his visit
        * Later phase, US damage on civilians by The Operation Rolling Thunder bombing,  Agent Orange, Napalm, etc led to further anti-US
        * Led to support of citizens to Vietcong, which was needed for guerilla
          * significant
      * Unpopular Batista
        * Batista used brutal forces to keep Cuba under control
        * Able to present as fighters for liberalization rather than terrorists
        * This led to corporative attitute of some citizens, but wasn't significant since the fight was short

      * television development
      * horrific scenes of villages burned, wars, etc affected
      * Anti-war musicians, including John Lennon contributed
    * Political Inability of US
      * weak political leadership
      * Johnson, who decided to enter the war by Tonking Gulf Incident in 1964
        * Aim containment and Domino Theory
      * Johnson viewed Vietcong as unpopular communist forces that could be easily defeated
      * Wrong policy of US not caring civilians (Rolling Thunder bombing etc), led to the outcome
      * However, as historian Tabor says, they had to do so because of guerilla, or lose
        * therefore this was also part of guerilla significance
  * Cuba
    * Cuban Weakness
      * Fight itself ended in 1 year (1958-59), much shorter than Vietnam war
      * Shows the inherent weakness of Batista government
        * unpopularity in the nation, even uS had to cut aid to Batisa in late 1950s
    * Historian Cushion highlights the effect of labor activists and political groups that also fought, independently from Guerilla
