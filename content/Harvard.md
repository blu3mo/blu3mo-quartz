- > MIT is not for those interested in a liberal arts major. But, I found it to be very supportive of my interests outside of science/math/engineering. It really is up to the individual to make use of the resources that are available at MIT (and there are a lot of them!). I also did not feel like I was looked down upon for having those interests - in fact, I ended up having a wider circle of friends at MIT and across Boston/Cambridge. The ability to cross-register at Harvard is a great perk if you take advantage of it as well.
- >  I was pleasantly surprised with the level of a lot of the "liberal artsy" classes I took at MIT. In fact, I felt the instructors as well as discussions in liberal arts classes at MIT were very high quality in terms of content (sometimes much higher than some of the classes I took at Harvard).
