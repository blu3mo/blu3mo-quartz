    - > We require at least a 102 overall score and give consideration to those with subscores of 25 and above.

- > CMU is divided into different colleges - engineering is separate from liberal arts, for example. You cannot easily move from one college to the other. If you are admitted to college of liberal arts, you are not permitted to major in engineering, for example. MIT has no such restrictions. Once admitted to MIT, you can major in anything you like.
