>  However, this impression of totalitarian control through chaos is viewed by Structuralist historians as merely superficial. Structualist’s hold that the Nazi regime and its policies evolved from functional pressures, interpreting the confusion of the Nazi Governmental system, not as a tool for control, but as a reflection of the limits on Hitler’s power due to influence from other sources
