	- As someone who loves to explore and discover new things, the "Fog of World" app has been my perfect companion. It allows me to visualize every pixel of a world map as I step into a new place. Over the past 4 years, I've used it to uncover hidden gems in my own neighborhood, like a cozy cafe and an unnoticed shrine, and even in other cities like Tokyo. Even when I accidentally miss trains or take wrong routes, the app helps me enjoy taking the new route.
	- So far, I've explored 0.000008036894431% of the earth's surface, and I'm always eager to uncover more.
