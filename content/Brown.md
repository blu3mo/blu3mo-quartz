> One of the most competitive schools in the country, Brown trusts its students to make wise academic decisions. As such, though there are no true course requirements outside of one’s major, the university will likely not admit a student who will only take gym classes, or cooking classes, or anything else requiring little academic fortitude. Instead, Brown accepts students who don’t need requirement to challenge themselves, or to take a wide array of classes. And thus, I think the students succeed because they’re smart, erudite, and motivated individuals. Not specifically because of the general education guidelines set up in their school.

>  For that reason, I’m not sure if such an environment would work at a bigger school like Penn State, or at a school with less talented, less motivated students. Brown is a unique school, and sets up nicely to no core requirements.
