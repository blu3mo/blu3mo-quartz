- Asanaに負けた話
> In this instance, I learned a lot.
>  The key takeaways are:
>  1. If you are in a competitive VC-funded space, it’s foolish to compete without raising money. Don't bring a knife to a gun fight.
>  2. The best product doesn’t always win, and product is not a longterm competitive advantage.
>  3. If a tree falls in the forest and nobody is around to hear it, it didn’t fall.
>  4. Every developer in the world wakes up thinking “I should build a to-do list app” and people love jumping between productivity apps and workflows. There is no moat in productivity—avoid it if you can.
>  5. Running a SaaS business without deeply understanding churn, LTV, CAC etc, is like flying a plane without instrumentation—really stupid and dangerous.
>  6. Failure sneaks up on you slowly, then all at once.
>  7. R&D is EXPENSIVE. Especially when competing with venture.
>  8. If you’re competing on features, it never stops and is an ever-increasing line item.
>  9. Good product with great marketing beats amazing product with no marketing.
>  10. Bootstrapping works best in uncompetitive spaces/niches or if you have an unfair advantage (a personal brand, unique customer acquisition channel, etc).
