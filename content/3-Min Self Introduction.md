# Shutaro Aoyama
ü¶Å Columbia '26 SEAS
üáØüáµ From Tokyo, Japan (not exactly)

My Interest
- üíª Applications of CS, Human Computer Interaction
- ü§î Philosophy of Mind, Phenomenology
- Major: CS (probably) & Minor: Philosophy (maybe?)

Past Projects/Researches
- ‚è≥ Thinking about concepts and applications of ==Virtual Time==
    - Just like having virtual space in VR, we could also have virutal time
        - ‚Üí get rid of restrictions of physical time (linear speed, unstoppable)
    - To explain in a more complex way:
        - Virtually creating an experience of multithreaded time by artificially creating sense of sync with others
    - Application:
        - Kineto: Online lecture platform that has benefits of both live and recorded lectures
            - decieves student's time to create virtual time experience
            - Research / Dev supervised by Prof. Inami from UTokyo
            - (Mitou-Program: Gov. gives me money and mentor)

        - Multithreaded voice communication (WIP)
            - Internship @ Yoshida Lab at UTokyo
    - Thinking to apply CS & philosophy of mind to explore this concept
    - Would love to talk/discuss more about this if you're interested!

Carrer Path
- still undecided
- probably Ph.D. in CS, HCI?

What I want from this class
- Get inspired by researches of peers/faculties
    - research process, methods, focuses, etc.
- Get to know each other üôå
