- リベラルアーツみよりは理系みが強いっぽい?
    - [If I think of myself as a liberal arts kind of student, does it make sense for me to consider MIT or Caltech? Should I go there if I’m interested in psychology, English, or politics? - Quora](https://www.quora.com/If-I-think-of-myself-as-a-liberal-arts-kind-of-student-does-it-make-sense-for-me-to-consider-MIT-or-Caltech-Should-I-go-there-if-I’m-interested-in-psychology-English-or-politics)
    - > Caltech offers a highly distilled scientific experience, and is not oriented toward a "liberal arts kind of student."
    - ただ、
        - > Another thing to keep in mind is that while the stereotype of a Caltech student is a humanities hating math-geek and engineer, you'd be surprised at the number of students who have a strong interest outside of their main scientific love. In my estimate, I'd say that about half of Caltech undergraduate students couldn't care less about the softer sciences, but the other half could talk your ear off about the literature of magical realism or a recent book they read on evolutionary psychology.
