### Focus of the topic
- ミリオタ的な細かい知識よりも、significance to outcomeの理由をちゃんと書くことが大事

### Background Info

### Body
Air
- WW1 Europe
    - Drastically developped during the war
    - Zeppelin airship
        - only Germany
        - not effective:
            - big and slow, easy target
            - Hydrogen baloon, flammable
    - Aircrafts
        - First military use
        - First for reconnaissance missions, then dog fight
        - However, most still in dev phase
            - Ex of development: propellers blocked bullets fired from machineguns
            - Not really used effectively
            - Slow, easy target from the ground
- WW2 Pacific
    - Strategic bombing
        - Aerial bombardments were usually done by America to Japan.
        - Significant Ex: Doolittle raid
            - bombing to the city of Tokyo
            - Fire bombs were used
                - Many buildings were wooden, so vulnerable to wood
                - More than 600000 houses were burnt down, along with 220000 victims of the attack.
            - Those bombing to the Japan mainland affected the industrial production, so it affected the outcome to a large extent.
    - Atomic bombs
        - developped on Manhattan Project by America, to develop massive destruction weapons.
        - It was used in the final phase of the war on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and it is known as the direct factor of the surrender of Japan.
        - Debatable, but atleast clearly one of direct cause of surrendar
- Summary: WW1 still in dev phase & cancelled out / WW2: Only US could attack mainland, so affected significantly


Land
- WW1
    - Chemical Gas
        - Chroline yelloiwsh gas was used
        - Damages respiratory system
        - Ineffective, because
            - Attack wasn’t stable,  damages  themselves  by wind
            - Gas masks were soon invented
            - Was easy to notice, by  color and smell
    - Machine Gun
        - First version has many limitations
        - Needed 4+ people to fire  because  it  was  heavy,  also  produced  heat
        - Improvements w ere made, less recoil and easier transportation
        - Both nations effectively used it, cancelles out, did not
    - Tanks
        - Ineffective, because:
            - Slow to cross the trench
            - Stuck  in the mud, fields were muddy
            - Easy target for enemy
- WW2
    - Bazookas
        - used by the US army
        - Short range, but could destroy light tanks
        - Cheaper than tank, so effective to some extent
- Summary:
    - WW1, not significant
        - most were still ineffective  (big and slow, easy target)
        - countertechnologis invented
        - cancelled out by technology
    - WW2 had some more effect, but not deciding factor


Sea
- WW1
    - Sea technology was important for Britain and Germany.
    - Ex: U-boat, Blockade
    - U-boats
        - Ineffective
        - Coutermeasures created
            - Depth Charge to attack
            - Hydrophone (primitive sonar) to detect
                - Once detected, hard for slow U-boat to run away
    - Dreadnaught
        - Never really used, stayed at the port
        - Too expensive to lose
- WW2
    - Ex: Aircraft carriers, Submarines
    - Submarines
        - Used by both forces to attack enemy fleets and merchant ships
        - The US successfully sunk 1.5M tons of Japanese merchant shipping
        - it was crucial to weaken the Japanese industry and economy.
    - Naval Codes & Code breaking
        - Both nations used naval codes on communication, to protect their information from others.
        - US cracked most of them until the end of the war.
        - The US knew the attack on the Battle of Midway, and was able to counter the attack.
            - Codebreaking helped the victory on Midway which was one of the most important battles.
        - Therefore codebreaking technology affected the outcome of the war

- However Paragraph
    - WW1
        - Weak allies of Germany

        - Blockade
            - Developed navy technologies  used for  Blockade
            - Britain blocked trade with Germany 1914-19
                - Patroled northern sea, intercepted merchant ships
            - Germany heavily relied on import
            - Shortage of fuel, food
            - 700000+ Germans died by starvation or disease
            - led to riots
            - Heavy damage to civilians affected the German surrender
            - Not only resources, but communications
                - Cutted underwater communication cables of Germany
        - Amerieca entry

        - Manpower
            - Allies (British Empire etc) supplies from colonies
    - WW2
        - Banzai charge
            - suicidal last attack
            - when Japan was losing the war
                - ex: 4000 Japanese died in Saipan
            - Not so effective to produce casualities, but feared
        - Island Hopping
            - Skipping heavily protected islands, and taking other islands
                - heavily protected islands will lose logistics, so they eventually starved
        - Outproduced Japan
            - Total War in the US, Industry for military production
            - 20x more production of tanks 1939-45
        - Kamikaze
                    - US AF 1999: Kamikaze same as anti-ship missiles
                    - However, ut became ineffective because:
                        - US Anti-Kamikaze technology
                            - Reinforced hull of aircraft carriers during the war
                            - Later time period, Kamikaze became ineffective
                        - Difficult to aim specific part that could sink warships
        - Soviet invasion of Manchuria
- Summary: Inequality of technology significantly affected the war in Ww2
