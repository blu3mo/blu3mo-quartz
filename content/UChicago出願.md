[Frequently Asked Questions | College Admissions](https://collegeadmissions.uchicago.edu/contact/frequently-asked-questions)
>  Is there a word limit or suggested word limit to your essay responses?
>  We suggest that you note any word limits for Coalition or Common Application essays; however, there are no strict word limits on the UChicago Supplement essays. For the extended essay (where you choose one of several prompts), we suggest that you aim for around 650 words. While we won't, as a rule, stop reading after 650 words, we're only human and cannot promise that an overly wordy essay will hold our attention indefinitely. For the “Why UChicago?” essay, we suggest about 250-500 words. The ideas in your writing matter more than the exact number of words you use!
