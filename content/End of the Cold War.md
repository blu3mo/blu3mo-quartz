How did the Arms Race come to an end?
•Reagan’s new Cold War (SDI, Evil Empire, Reagan Doctrine)
New Cold War:ending the detente (lasts until 1985)
Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI):An anti-ballistic missile program, shooting down missiles in space, “Star Wars”
Evil Empire (1983):Reagan referring USSR to an evil empire, increasing ideological tension
Reagan Doctrine:The concept was to stop the spread of communism before it could attack a country, Reagan sent troops to Grenada to stop a communist invasion, supporting anti-communist fighters in Afghanistan

•Renewed Détente (Afghanistan, China)
Afghanistan (1986):Gorbachev withdrew his troops from Afghanistan as their foreign policy did not work, replacement of president (Mohammed Najibullah)
China:PRC frontiers and Soviet troops were reduced, relation fully restored
•End of Arms race (arms reduction treaties, conferences)
START treaty(1991):LImited the number of ICBMs and nuclear warhead that can be possessed
Warsaw Pact and NATO me to sign the treaty on conventional armed force in Europe:reduction of weapons in Europe
Annual meetings to prevent conflicts


Why did Communism collapse in Eastern Europe by 1990? (Shutaro) (Textbook p267-)
•Economic and Political conditions of Eastern Europe by 1980’s
2 Types of nations
Type 1:Poland/Hungary/Bulgaria
Proactive to proceed limited political and economic reform
Type 2:GDR, Czechslovakia, Romania, Albania
Unwilling to proceed reforms
(Ignored Yugoslavia, irregular)
•Revolution of Type 1: Impact of Gorbachev’s reforms (end Brezhnev doctrine)
Gorbachev ending Brezhnev doctorine 1989
Aimed to maintain Soviet security at Eastern Europe by negotiation and cooperation, not by force.
Pol/Hun/Bul: Revolutionary changes occurred with negotiation with ruling communists
Ex: Poland: (negotiation)
Issues such as Indebted economic situation and corrupted government and industry existed
Due to this, people forced government to legalize Solidarity.
Solidarity and PUWP(communists) agreed to allow Solidarity to compete for 35% of seats in the lower parliament
However, election proved the popularity of Solidarity, and government got transformed to a regime led by Solidarity
Important: Gorbachev did not oppose this entire process, and Poland remained in Warsaw Pact
Known as “Negotiated revolutions”
•Revolution of Type 2: Impact of opening of Berlin Wall
Berlin Wall opened 1989/11/9
GDR/CzSl/Rom/Alb:
Ex: Germany:
Leipzig demonstrations 1989 9/25-10/16
Non-violent protestors
Non-violent governments
Support of Soviet Union wasn’t provided to communists
Led to replacement of Honecker by Krenz
Accidental opening of Berlin Wall
Crowds gathered at the border on 11/9
Ex: Romania:
Ceausescu was unpopular due to his failure of economic/political policies.
Opening of Berlin Wall induced the revolution
The first revolts at Timisoara 1989/12/9
Army sided the people
Soviet Union did not intervene.
Ceausescu fled the capital, but got executed on 12/22
National Salvation Front (left-side party) was then formed, and gained majority in elections.
Communist remained in power after democratic elections, as Gorbachev hoped.
There were unexpected revolutions for the Soviet Union
