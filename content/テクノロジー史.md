- テクノロジー、自然に生まれるみたいに思われがち
    - でも、human causesが絶対存在する

テクノロジーの定義
> modest definition will suffice to begin inquiry: technology is the systematic, purposeful, human manipulation of the physical world by means of some machine or tool


- science historyとtech historyは分裂

- [[決定論]]的な、二つの要素
    - [[社会構成論vs技術決定論]]

- [[アクターネットワーク理論]]
    - > Building these networks involves not only other people, but also things—artifacts—and institutions.

- historians of technologyがよくやること
    - > Above all, historians of technology are trained to question the “linear model”—one device giving way to the next in a succession of improvements, following the classic “internalist” progression.
    - “Symmetrical analysis” examines the features they share, which helps investigators avoid the assumption that a functioning technology is the one best way to accomplish a task.
        - wrong assumptionを避ける
        - historians ask: for whom did it work better, for which “relevant social groups,” and why did those folks exert more influence than those daredevils who preferred (for example) a bicycle with one big wheel and one relatively tiny one?
        - テクノロジー自体だけではなく、どんな人なら上手く使いこなせたかとかも考える
    - The history of technology means to understand not only machines and tools but also the systems that make those devices work for and against human purposes. Successful technological systems throughout history have incorporated nontechnological elements: gender roles, financial institutions, hurricanes, and human urges. And everything else, too.
        - 機械やツールそのものだけではなく、それを動かすための環境の影響とかも扱うよ、と言う話
            - nontechnological elements (性別、金銭的問題、災害とか）も見る
