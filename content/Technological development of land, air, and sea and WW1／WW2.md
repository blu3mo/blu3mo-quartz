 'Technological development of land, air, and sea and WW1／WW2'
---

- Land
    - Chemical Gas
        - Chroline yelloiwsh gas  was used
        - Damages respiratory system
        - Attack wasn’t stable,  damages  themselves  by wind
        - Gas masks were invented
    - Machine Gun
        - First version has many limitations
        - Needed 4+ people to fire  because  it  was  heavy,  also  produced  heat
        - Improvements w ere made, less recoil and easier transportation
        - Both nations effectively used it, cancelles out, did not

- Air
    - Secondly, Air Forces were used in the war as well. Technologies relating to the Air Force drastically developed in the time of WW1, and various technologies were used for military purposes for the first time.
    - One of them is “Zeppelin”, which is an airship developed in Germany. It made possible for Germany to directly attack lands that were not accessible through the land. WW1 was also the first war with aircraft in large-scale use, and various technologies were developed for military use of aircrafts. For instance, German military faced a problem that propellers blocks the bullet fired from machine guns, and Machine Gun Synchronization technology was developed as a solution for this. Both of them were used for reconnaissance missions in the early time of WW1, but eventually nations started to use them for more offensive purposes such as bombing and dog-fight.
    - However, most Air Force technologies were still in the development phase. They still had issues, so it did not largely affect the outcome of the war compared with land / sea technologies. Germany attempted bombing attacks on London using Zeppelins several times, but they were still vulnerable to bombing attacks and weather. They did succeed to bomb several sites in the UK, but the attack was not stable.
    - Therefore, Aircraft technology did drastically develop during the first world war. However, since they were still in the development stage, the effect of technology was not large comparatively.

- Sea
    - Sea technology was important for Britain and Germany.
    - U-boat
        - Submarine
        - Tiny U-boat sunk 3 British cruisers
        - Made battleships vulnerable.
        - Submarines and counter-submarine technology developed
        - Britain successfully countered submarine on the battle of Jutland, let Germany make further development
    - Blockade
        - Developed navy technologies  used for  Blockade
        - Britain blocked trade with Germany 1914-19
            - Patroled northern sea, intercepted merchant ships
        - Germany heavily relied on import
        - Shortage of fuel, food
        - 700000+ Germans died by starvation or disease
        - Heavy damage to civilians affected the German surrender

- Conclusion
    - Countertechnologies were mostly developed, or cancelled out
    - Many including air forces still in development
    - Sea blockade was effective
