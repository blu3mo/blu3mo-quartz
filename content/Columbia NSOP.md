    - ちゃんと社交的でいたい
    - > --lastly we call it NSLOP for a reason, its time to get sloppy, make new friends and feel really lucky that you go to college in NYC and can't complain about being bored on the weeklends like your friends who go to school in Ithaca do.

- オリエンテーション中にplacement testもあるのね
    - > -Take all the placement tests for everything that you might remotely consider studying otherwise you'll regret it later because many of these placement tests are ONLY administered during NSOP. For calc you can place out immediately with an AP test. For things like Chem, Physics, languages you can AP into higher sections or take a placement exam. You don't have to study in advance as the exams are designed to place you into the appropriate level for your skillset and you would likely be unprepared for any level other than where the placement test would put you.
- international向けのプログラムもある

- CARE
    - まあこれはこれで面白い体験にはなりそう、楽しみ
