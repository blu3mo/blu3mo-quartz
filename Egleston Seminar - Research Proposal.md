‚è≥ Communication Model under Virtual Reality of Time

* RQ: What is the ==optimal model of communication== under the manipulated time perception?
* SEAS '26 Shutaro Aoyama

üëì Background: Time perception can be manipulated by VR

* MetaChron Platform (Landeck, et al.)
  
  * A project by Neuroscientists, Psychologists, Computer Scientists and Philosophers from multiple universities in Europe

  * However,
    * Applications are limited to psychopathological conditions
    * Method of manipulation of time is limited
* Interface That Enables to Coexist Real-Time and Slow-Motion. (Muramoto, et al)

  * Shows different images to Left and Right eyes
  * However
    * Research limits its scope to the study of methodology
* TL:DR; We can manipulate time perception using VR.

üí≠ My Research

* However, current applications are all about time perception of indivisuals
  * How about time manipulation during inter-personal communication?
* To think about that, we need a new ==model of communication==
  * RQ: What is the optimal model of communication under the manipulated time perception?
* Current model: assuming shared and continuous flow of time
  * We assume that we all share the same "moment"
  * Communication doesn't work under time-manipulation
* New model: Live in one's manipulated time, and synchronize when needed.
  * "Elastic Sync"
  * Model: ![image](https://gyazo.com/45a4fa1c5606e3d794db4d053633ef61/thumb/1000)
    * Algorithm to cluster people and manipulate people's time speed
  * Experiment in Non-VR

üåü Applicatons

* By applying time perception manipulation to communication,
* Multithreaded Voice communication
  * Current voice communication: Half-duplex Communication
    * Only one person can talk at the same time
  * With manipulated time, multithreaded voice communication?
* Realtime & interactive lecture that can be time-manipulated
  * Do time-manipulations like "go back 10sec" "fast-forward" "pause"
  * In a real-time and interactive lecture

üèÉ What I'll do

* Research Intern? @ Superception Lab, Sony CSL / UTokyo
* Study Phenomenology @ Columbia
