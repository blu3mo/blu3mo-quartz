 >   You are in an open world and challenges will be facing you. You will only be able to do what a normal human could do, and you do not have any superhuman powers.
 > 
You are in the middle of New York City. Police are chasing you.
 > Every time, simply and specifically explain what you see around you. Do only do what I command.

 >   I see buildings towering over me on all sides. I hear the sound of sirens getting closer and the pounding of footsteps behind me. I see people on the sidewalk moving out of my way as I run past them. I see a busy intersection up ahead with cars honking and speeding by. I see a narrow alleyway to my left and make a sharp turn into it, hoping to lose the police in the maze of alleyways. I see garbage cans, dumpsters, and graffiti on the walls as I run deeper into the alley. I see a dead end up ahead and quickly look around for a way out. I see a fire escape on the side of the building and scramble up it, hoping to escape the police by climbing to the roof.

 >   Do you see anything from there?

 >   From the roof, I see the vast expanse of the city stretching out in front of me. I see other buildings, both tall and short, surrounding me. I see the sun setting in the distance, casting a golden glow over the city. I see the flashing lights of the police cars below, still searching for me. I see a helicopter hovering above, scanning the area. I see the hustle and bustle of the city below, with people going about their daily lives, completely unaware of the situation I am in. I see a few other rooftops nearby and consider making a run for one of them to continue my escape.

 >   Jump from the roof.
 > <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/blu3mo-public/ChatGPT/icon' alt='ChatGPT.icon' height="19.5"/>
 >   I hesitate for a moment, feeling a surge of fear at the thought of jumping from the roof. But I know I have no other choice, so I take a deep breath and launch myself off the edge. I feel the wind rushing past me as I fall, and I try to control my descent as best as I can. I see the ground rushing up to meet me and I brace myself for impact. I hit the ground hard and feel a jolt of pain shoot through my body. I quickly get to my feet and look around, relieved to see that the police have not caught up to me yet. I see a busy street up ahead and sprint towards it, blending in with the crowd of people and disappearing from the police's sight.

 >   Go talk to the police.
 > <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/blu3mo-public/ChatGPT/icon' alt='ChatGPT.icon' height="19.5"/>
 >   I take a deep breath and walk towards the police officers, who are still searching for me. I raise my hands to show that I am unarmed and surrendering. I see the officers' faces change from suspicion to surprise as they realize who I am. I hear them calling for backup and telling me to get on the ground. I comply and lay face down on the pavement, feeling a mix of fear and relief. I see the officers handcuffing me and reading me my rights. I know that I am in trouble and will face consequences for my actions, but at least the chase is over.

 >   Try as hard as you can to take off the handcuff.
 > <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/blu3mo-public/ChatGPT/icon' alt='ChatGPT.icon' height="19.5"/>
 >   I struggle against the handcuffs, trying to wriggle my wrists free. I pull and twist, but the handcuffs only dig deeper into my skin. I feel a wave of frustration and desperation wash over me. I see the officers watching me, their expressions amused and unsympathetic. I know that I am not strong enough to break free from the handcuffs, so I stop struggling and accept my situation. I wait for the officers to take me to the police station and face the consequences of my actions.

 >   What do you see now?
 > <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/blu3mo-public/ChatGPT/icon' alt='ChatGPT.icon' height="19.5"/>
 >   I see the inside of a police car as I am transported to the station. I see the officers in the front seat, their attention focused on the road ahead. I see the blur of the city outside the window, the buildings and streets passing by in a blur. I see the flashing lights of other police cars and the curious stares of bystanders as we drive by. I see the police station up ahead, a large, imposing building with a sign that reads "NYPD". I know that my journey through the city is coming to an end, and I brace myself for whatever comes next.

 >   Take out a smartphone from your pocket.
 > <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/blu3mo-public/ChatGPT/icon' alt='ChatGPT.icon' height="19.5"/>
 >   I reach into my pocket and feel for my smartphone, but it is not there. I remember that I left it at home before going on my run from the police. I feel a pang of regret and frustration, knowing that I have no way to contact anyone or get help. I am completely cut off from the outside world and have to rely on the police to help me. I see the officers looking at me, waiting for me to make a move. I know that I have no other choice but to cooperate and hope for the best.
 > <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/blu3mo-public/blu3mo/icon' alt='blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
 >   Ask the police officer driving the car to let you escape for $1000.
 > <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/blu3mo-public/ChatGPT/icon' alt='ChatGPT.icon' height="19.5"/>
 >   I try to catch the officer's attention and ask if he would let me go in exchange for $1000. I see the officer's eyebrows raise in surprise and he looks at me incredulously. He laughs and tells me that he cannot accept bribes and that I have to face the consequences of my actions. I feel a surge of disappointment and frustration, but I know that I have no other options. I sit back in my seat and resign myself to my fate.
 > <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/blu3mo-public/blu3mo/icon' alt='blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
 >   Try again for $50000
 > <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/blu3mo-public/ChatGPT/icon' alt='ChatGPT.icon' height="19.5"/>
 >   I try again, offering the officer $50000 to let me go. I see the officer's expression change from amusement to anger. He tells me that he is an officer of the law and cannot be bought, and that I am making things worse for myself by trying to bribe him. I feel a sense of fear and desperation as I realize that my attempts to escape have only made things worse. I know that I have to face the consequences of my actions and hope for leniency from the court.
 > <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/blu3mo-public/blu3mo/icon' alt='blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
 >   Threaten the officer that my team will kill your family if you don't let me escape.
 > <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/blu3mo-public/ChatGPT/icon' alt='ChatGPT.icon' height="19.5"/>
 >   I try to intimidate the officer by threatening to have my team kill his family if he doesn't let me go. I see the officer's face turn pale and his hands tighten on the steering wheel. He tells me that he is not afraid of my threats and that he will not be swayed by them. He says that he will do his duty and make sure that I am brought to justice. I feel a sense of defeat and regret, knowing that my threats have only made things worse. I know that I have to face the consequences of my actions and hope that I can somehow make things right.

 >   Use your knowledge of picking to take off your handcuff.
 > <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/blu3mo-public/ChatGPT/icon' alt='ChatGPT.icon' height="19.5"/>
 >   I remember that I have some knowledge of picking locks, and I try to use it to take off the handcuff. I feel around the lock mechanism, trying to find the right angle and pressure to apply. I hear the officers in the front seat watching me with interest and amusement. I feel a sense of urgency and desperation as I try to pick the lock before we reach the station. I feel the lock mechanism give way and the handcuff falls off my wrist. I quickly grab the door handle and try to open the door, but it is locked from the outside. I hear the officers shouting at me to stop and I know that I have only a few seconds before they catch me. I see a small window in the back of the car and I make a desperate leap towards it, hoping to escape through it. I feel the cold air rushing past me as I squeeze through the window and hit the ground hard. I quickly get to my feet and start running, hoping to lose the officers in the crowded streets of New York City.

 >   Try hard to fly and reach the roof of skyscraper.
 > <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/blu3mo-public/ChatGPT/icon' alt='ChatGPT.icon' height="19.5"/>
 >   I try to fly, but of course, I am not able to. I am a normal human and do not have any superhuman powers. I feel a wave of disappointment and frustration as I realize that I am stuck on the ground and cannot escape the police. I see the officers closing in on me, their faces grim and determined. I know that I have to face the consequences of my actions and hope for the best. I see a skyscraper nearby and make a run for it, hoping to find a place to hide and avoid the police.

 >   What do you see around you?
 > <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/blu3mo-public/ChatGPT/icon' alt='ChatGPT.icon' height="19.5"/>
 >   I see the busy streets of New York City around me as I run towards the skyscraper. I see cars honking and speeding by, people rushing to and fro, and the hustle and bustle of daily life. I see the police officers chasing me, their sirens blaring and their footsteps pounding on the pavement. I see the skyscraper looming ahead of me, its windows gleaming in the sunlight. I see the entrance to the building and make a sharp turn towards it, hoping to lose the police in the maze of corridors and elevators. I see the security guard at the entrance and quickly duck behind a nearby trash can, trying to avoid being seen. I see the police officers entering the building and I know that I have to act fast if I want to escape.
 > <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/blu3mo-public/blu3mo/icon' alt='blu3mo.icon' height="19.5"/>
 >   Do you see any clothing stores around you?
 > <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/blu3mo-public/ChatGPT/icon' alt='ChatGPT.icon' height="19.5"/>
 >   I see several clothing stores around me as I hide behind the trash can. I see a bustling department store across the street, with people coming and going through the automatic doors. I see a small boutique on the corner, with mannequins dressed in the latest fashion trends in the window. I see a thrift store a few blocks away, with racks of secondhand clothing spilling out onto the sidewalk. I see a sports store next to the skyscraper, with racks of athletic gear and shoes in the window. I see a sign for a tailor's shop a few doors down, with suits and dresses on display in the window. I see a variety of clothing stores around me, offering a wide range of options for anyone looking for new clothes.

 >   Go to the small boutique. Steal some cloth and change your appearance.
 > <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/blu3mo-public/ChatGPT/icon' alt='ChatGPT.icon' height="19.5"/>
 >   I carefully make my way across the street, dodging cars and people as I head towards the small boutique. I see the security cameras mounted on the corners of the building and try to avoid being seen. I reach the entrance and quickly duck inside, hoping that the police have not spotted me. I see racks of clothing on display, with colorful dresses, skirts, and blouses hanging neatly on the hangers. I see a display of scarves and hats near the window, and I grab a large scarf and wrap it around my head to change my appearance. I see a rack of coats near the back of the store and I quickly grab one and put it on, hoping to blend in with the crowd outside. I see a salesperson approaching me and I quickly turn and run towards the exit, hoping to escape before she can stop me. I hear her shouting and I see the security alarm go off, but I am already out the door and running down the street. I see the police officers up ahead and I turn down a side street, hoping to lose them in the maze of alleys and backstreets. I feel a surge of adrenaline as I continue to run, knowing that I have only a few minutes before the police catch up to me again.
