 > I understand your situation and  have examined the settings for Google Takeout. Takeout is not a part of the core services of G-Suite. As such, under our terms and conditions of Google G-Suite for Education, I cannot enable this facility for any user under 18 years of age without permission. Enabling this service would require GKA Administrators permission and parent consent. The system does not allow for individual settings so, for example, we would need to receive parent consent from EVERY student in Grades 11 & 12 in order to enable this for Senior students. Realistically this is not possible.
