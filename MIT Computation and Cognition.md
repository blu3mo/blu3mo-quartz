[My Major, Course 6-9 | MIT Admissions](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/my-major-course-6-9/)

* あ、newest majorなんだ

* Two main (informal) tracks emerge that encompass well the many areas one could focus on within Course 6-9. They are (1) Human and Machine Intelligence and (2) Neural Engineering. Some explain it as human and machine intelligence being a combination of 6-3 and 9 while neural engineering is more of a combination between 6-1 and 9.

* interdiciplinary

* *実装によって新しいモデルを探求する*
