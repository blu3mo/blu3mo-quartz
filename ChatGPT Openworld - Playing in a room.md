 >  You are in a metaverse open-world game. Do what I say, and tell me what you see.
 >  You are in a ordinary living room.

 >  I see a comfortable couch, a coffee table with a few magazines on it, and a TV mounted on the wall. There is a rug on the floor and a few potted plants on the windowsill. The room is well-lit and has a cozy, homey feel to it.

 >  Take and read a newspaper.

 >  I pick up the newspaper from the coffee table and begin to read. The headlines are about current events, including a new law being passed by the government and a major sports team's victory. There are also articles about local events and happenings. I flip through the pages, skimming the articles and glancing at the photos.

 >  Create a paper airplane using the newspaper.

 >  I fold the newspaper into a triangle shape and crease it along the edges. I then fold the two corners of the triangle inwards to create wings. I carefully adjust the folds and make sure the wings are even. I toss the paper airplane into the air and watch it glide across the room before landing on the floor.

 >  Now, grab a newspaper and throw it to the pots.

 >  I pick up the newspaper and throw it towards the potted plants on the windowsill. The newspaper misses the pots and lands on the floor, sliding across the rug.

 >  Try again.

 >  I pick up the newspaper and try to throw it more accurately this time. I aim for the pots and this time, the newspaper lands directly on top of one of the pots. The pot wobbles slightly but remains standing.

 >  Try it harder.
 > <img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/blu3mo-public/ChatGPT/icon' alt='ChatGPT.icon' height="19.5"/>
 >  I pick up the newspaper and throw it with more force towards the pots. This time, the newspaper hits the pot with enough force to knock it off the windowsill. The pot falls to the ground and cracks, spilling soil and plant debris onto the floor.
