* Asanaに負けた話

 > 
 > In this instance, I learned a lot.
 > The key takeaways are:
 > 
 > 1. If you are in a competitive VC-funded space, it’s foolish to compete without raising money. Don't bring a knife to a gun fight.
 > 1. The best product doesn’t always win, and product is not a longterm competitive advantage.
 > 1. If a tree falls in the forest and nobody is around to hear it, it didn’t fall.
 > 1. Every developer in the world wakes up thinking “I should build a to-do list app” and people love jumping between productivity apps and workflows. There is no moat in productivity—avoid it if you can.
 > 1. Running a SaaS business without deeply understanding churn, LTV, CAC etc, is like flying a plane without instrumentation—really stupid and dangerous.
 > 1. Failure sneaks up on you slowly, then all at once.
 > 1. R&D is EXPENSIVE. Especially when competing with venture.
 > 1. If you’re competing on features, it never stops and is an ever-increasing line item.
 > 1. Good product with great marketing beats amazing product with no marketing.
 > 1. Bootstrapping works best in uncompetitive spaces/niches or if you have an unfair advantage (a personal brand, unique customer acquisition channel, etc).
