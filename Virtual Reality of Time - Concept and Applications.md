üë®‚Äçüíª Who am I

* Shutaro Aoyama
* Freshman at Columbia University
  * School of Engineering and Applied Science
* [Bluemo (@blu3mo) / Twitter](https://twitter.com/blu3mo)
* Interest: Making absolute things relative by engineering interaction of human and environment
  * Relativizing reality, time, space, gender, etc

üìï What is "Virtual Time"?

* Analogy: Virtual Reality for Time, not Space
  * üó∫ Physical Space vs Virtual Space

  * üïë Physical Time vs ==Virtual Time==
    * (relativizing physical time)
* Definition:
  * Def. of Virtual Reality:
    * 
       > 
       > Experience that superfically seems different from reality, but virtually has the same effect as reality (Hirose, 2019)
  
  * Then,  def. of Virtual Time:
    * 
       > 
       > Experience of "time" that superfically seems different from real time, but ==virtually has the same effect as time==.

üõ† How is it possible?

* i.e. How could we reconstruct the virtual effect of time?
* Virtual Space:
  * Perception of space: Internal Sense of Space + External Stimulis
    * External Stimulis: Sight, Sound, Haptics, etc
  * Experience to move in virtual space can be constructed by artificial stimulis
  * Virtual Space has more freedom
    * Fly, Warp, Non-euclidian space, etc
* Virtual Time:
  * Perception of time: Internal Sense + External Stimulis
    * External Stimulis: Sense of sync with other changing actors (clocks, people, etc)
      * (hypothesis)
  * Experience to move in virtual time can be constructed by artificial stimuli
  * Virtual Time has more freedom
    * Speed manipulation, Warp, Loop, etc

ü§î What I want to do with this concept

* Not forcing virtual reality/time, but giving an alternative choice of reality/time.

- Interactive lecture video streaming platform
    - Student-generated content overlayed on lecture video
- Goal: Combine merits of real-time and on-demand lectures
    - Merits of real-time lectures: Interactive communication between students
    - Merits of on-demand lectures: Control of time
- Method: Virtual time by giving artificial stimuli
    - Psuedo Sync Êì¨‰ººÂêåÊúü
        - Gives pseudo sense of sync with other students interacting on lectures
    - Elastic Sync ÂºæÊÄßÂêåÊúü
        - Secretly control playback speed within range of 0.9~1.2x
        - Sync unsynchronized students

- Issue of current voice communication: Only one thread available
    - Difficult to have branches of discussion
- Applying ==Elastic Sync == to create multithreaded voice communcation, where participants eventually receive content of every threads
