   > Someone else mentioned that the flexibility to take higher level courses of a different major is difficult, and claimed that other universities like MIT or CalTech or the "Ivies" would provide more "freedom". That's quite simply false. All high level classes have pre-requisites, most of which are essential to a well designed curriculum that build upon previously learned knowledge. Having taught both lower and upper level classes in engineering, this is essential and those who have attempted to skip those pre-requisites generally would not do so well because they have gaps in their learning. This is the same in all universities. This is not about "trust" in the undergraduates, this is about an effective learning structure, and ensuring that the limited resources that the UW still has is used efficiently for those who can benefit the most.

   > Research focus - which can be good for graduate students, but not so much for undergraduates since teaching can take a lower priority for some faculty members. All faculty (except Research Assistant Professors) are required to teach some classes, whether they want to or not. My suggestion is to get advice from Rate a Professor and your peers to figure out whose classes you should take.

   > Generally speaking, you have to survive your first 2 years at UW before you can select a major. Unlike many schools, most majors are competitive. So even if you get into UW, doesn’t mean you would get into the major of your choice. Two levels of selection. For example, Computer Science & Engineering is a highly competitive major. However, at many schools, once the university accepts you, you are welcome to choose whatever major you want. That is not the case at UW.
