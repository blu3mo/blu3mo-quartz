title: Computer Interface and Digital Divide
---

* Focus: How interface design could  make computers accesible/inaccesible
* Globally Significant Issue: Digital Divide
  * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide)
    * Mainly focus on Cognitive access, Design access

RQ idea: To what extent can the physical representation of (digital) information improve the accesibility for elderlies?
- or more broadly: What kind of interface could it improve the usability for elderlies?

Logic

* Introduce how to evaluate
  
  * *TAM* / *STAM*
* Then, evaluate types of concepts of interfaces  (Local Manifestations?)
  
  * Recent examples
    * [OOUI](OOUI.md)
    * [Tangible](Tangible.md) UI
    * *Chat UI* ("AI" as a human-like character to normal peoples )
  * Past examples
    * Emojis
    * Phones
  * these concepts discusses how to let users interact with domain models (CS) #ドメイン
* Since focusing on elderies,
  
  * maybe should focus more on sceptism than usability etc.
  * = focus on emotion to user interface
    * types of media to access information
* if  we focus on emotion,
  
  * could study history of Cybernetics
  * Relates to *Technological Determinism and Cybernetics in the Cold War*  (due nov.)
  * (need to be careful about double dipping)
* focus on  physical output?
  
  * see history
  * doubledipping
* apollo
  - spacesuit
  - new techs

* make decision  soon

* How to make [IBHistory](IBHistory.md) involed in the Essay
  
  * Use historical methods/perspectives to analyse the change/continuity of interface?
    * find technologies that followed the philosophy of tangible ui?
  * Focus more on incidents caused by inaccebility to technology?
  * 90s cell phone
    * national context until iPhone
  * globalization of interface
